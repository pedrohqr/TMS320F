# Library for TMS320F28XXX for signal processing
### The _TMS320F28XXX_ is a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) family from _Texas InstrumentsÂ©_ with vast features and power processing. You can see these features and more about DSP consulting [datasheet](https://www.ti.com/product/TMS320F28335).
### The content of this repository it is some algorithms about signal processing to use in this device. The requirement to use this unity codes is that you write your code until `C++11`.

## Algorithms
- Fast Fourier Transform (Time decimation in $\sqrt2$)

## Types
- Complex

### Note: These algorithms has been tested on _TMS320F28335_ DSP.
